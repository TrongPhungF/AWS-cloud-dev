# Full Stack Apps on AWS Project

## Project Overview

This project is developed to assist the FBI in finding missing people by building a **Node.js server** that uploads images to an FBI cloud database hosted on **AWS**. The images will be processed using facial recognition software to detect matches. The application is deployed via **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14+)
- **AWS CLI** (configured with credentials)
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI**
- **Git**

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TrongPhungF/AWS-cloud-dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd project-starter-code
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Project Structure

The main components of the project are as follows:

- **server.js**: Handles API requests and responses.
- **package.json**: Manages dependencies and includes scripts for running the application.
- **.elasticbeanstalk/**: Contains AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration.
- **README.md**: Documentation and project instructions.

## Running the Project Locally

You can run the application locally before deploying it to AWS.

### Start the Server

Run the server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Access the Application

Once the server is running, the app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8082`.

## Deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### AWS Setup

Ensure your AWS environment is properly configured.

1. **AWS CLI Configuration**

Run the following command to set up your AWS CLI with your credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, region, and output format when prompted.

2. **Elastic Beanstalk Initialization**

Initialize your Elastic Beanstalk environment:

```bash
eb init
```

3. **Deploy the Application**

To deploy your application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, run:

```bash
eb create
```

4. **Check Deployment Status**

Once the deployment is complete, you can check the environment status with:

```bash
eb status
```

### Elastic Beanstalk Application URL

After deployment, replace the placeholder with the actual URL of your Elastic Beanstalk application.

Example:

```
Deployed Application URL: http://your-eb-url/
```

Once you have the actual URL, you can access the API endpoint like this:

```bash
http://project-starter-code-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage?image_url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Golden_tabby_and_white_kitten_n01.jpg
```

## API Endpoints

The application includes the following key API endpoint:

- **GET /filteredimage**: This endpoint accepts an image URL, applies processing, and returns the filtered image.

### Example Request

```bash
curl "http://project-starter-code-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage?image_url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Golden_tabby_and_white_kitten_n01.jpg"
```

## Testing the Application

### Image URL Testing

Send a valid image URL to the `/filteredimage` endpoint to verify that the response contains the processed image.

### Error Handling

Test with invalid URLs or non-image content. The API should return appropriate error responses such as **400 Bad Request**.

### Example Test Command

```bash
curl "http://http://project-starter-code-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage?image_url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Golden_tabby_and_white_kitten_n01.jpg"
```

Expected Result: A successfully processed image should be returned.

## Known Issues

- Ensure your AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment is stable before testing.
- If the server times out or doesn’t respond, check the logs in the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard.
